# Slotcars
Slotcars is a HTML5 canvas game written in Javascript.

Slotcars is written by me, Iain McWhinnie. It's primary purpose is to showcase my programming skills and to learn about simple game development.

# Getting Started

You will need to locally host a web server to run the game. If you have [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed you can simply type
```shell
$ python -m http.server 
```
into the command line in the root directory.

The code uses the [MathJS project](https://mathjs.org/). It is used when code is preferenced with `math`.

# Learning

Mozilla provide some really useful documentation on Javascript and related parts which are useful to this project.
